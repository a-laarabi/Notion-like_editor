# Helpjuice Front-end assignment

This is a front-end developer test project. The webpage allows users to create H1 text by simply typing '/1' and provides a keyboard shortcut to streamline the process. The project utilizes React functional components with the use of hooks such as useRef, useState, useEffect and it makes use of other components such as NavBar, UserNav, and CmdPopup. The core functionality of the webpage lies in the editor-app component, which takes in an array of text and its corresponding tag, and maps it to the appropriate HTML tag. The CmdPopup component is triggered by the user typing '/' in the editor and displays a list of available tags for selection.
